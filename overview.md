Team Calendar helps busy teams stay on track and informed about important deadines, sprint schedules, and upcoming milestones. Team Calendar is the one place to see and manage the date important to your teams, including sprint schedule, days off (for individuals or the team), and custom events.

## Quick view of your sprint schedule

At a glance see when sprints start and end. No more guessing at how much time you have before the sprint ends.

## Easily manage days off 

From your team calendar, mark days you (or anyone on your team) will be out of the office. Simply click a day and choose to add a day off. No more digging around the capacity settings page to set or manage days off.

## Plan better

Visualize the availability of the team as you plan your team. Understand who is unavailable and when. Know ahead of time when you have multiple team members out at the same time.
