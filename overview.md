## Stay on track

Team Calendar is an extension for Visual Studio Online that helps busy teams stay on track and informed about important deadines, sprint schedules, and upcoming milestones. Team Calendar is the one place to see and manage the date important to your teams, including:

* Iterations 
* Days off (for individuals or the team)
* Custom events (single or multi-day)
